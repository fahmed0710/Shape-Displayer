# Shape-Displayer
Initially, the program displays three buttons on the top of the frame and a blank large area of a user-defined JPanel below the buttons. 
The buttons display a car (borrowed from textbook), a snow man, and a composite shape that consists of at least 4 primitive shapes. 

When the user clicks on one of the buttons, the shape displayed on the clicked button becomes the current shape. 
The icon representing the current shape outlines the shape.
When a mouse is clicked on the user-defined JPanel, the current shape is drawn on the position which the mouse was pressed on.

The current shape can be changed by clicking one of the buttons.

The application is reusable by any CompositeShape.
